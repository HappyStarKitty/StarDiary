## Mcculloch-Pitts model

MCP network is a directed graph that contains a set of neurons.

## Perceptron

XOR and identity can not be computed by a singel perceptron.

A perceptron can only compute linearly separable functions of n binary arguments.

## Supervised learning
## Unsupervised learning

strategy: winner-take-all
only one of the neurons is selected for a weight update

Convergence to a good solution can be accelerated by distributing the initial weight vectors according to an adequate heuristic.

alternative: "learning with conscience" algorithm

The attraction from each cluster can be modeled as so-called energy function.
