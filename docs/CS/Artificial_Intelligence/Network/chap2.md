The fuzzy logic(FL) is an extension of the binary logic(二元逻辑).

The crucial step towards the application of fuzzy logic to technical systems: to allow variables with linguistic(qualitative, fuzzy) values, to map them onto a numerical(quatitative) range and to process them at the numberical level automatically.

The major premise of fuzzy theory is the(for a human natural) incompatibility of high complexity and high precision(高复杂性和高精度的不可兼容性).

FL describes logical systems in the mathmatical sense, with the aim of implementing models representing human decision making(IF-THEN rule base)

In a fuzzy set, a so-called membership function(隶属度函数) assigns a numerical value to each element to the set, which is the degree of belonging to the set.

Membership degree and probablity are different in nature and have absolutely no correlation.

## Chap2b Neural Networks: Introduction

In associative learning, which provides a learning model for the supervised trained(有监督训练) artificial NN, a new response becomes associated with a particular stimulus

- instrumental conditioning
  learning the relationship between a stimulus(event) and a reaction 
- classical conditioning
  learning the relationships between two different events 

Structure and connnetion strengths(weights) of an ANN determine its behavior and represent the degrees of freedom during optimization.
